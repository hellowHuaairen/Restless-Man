# 04 - The Mainbar

The mainbar is where you can preview and edit the currently active note.

## Toolbar

The toolbar contains buttons for triggering actions to the current note, all of them are also accessible via shortcuts.

## Preview/Editor/Multi-Editor

Right below the toolbar there's the preview/editor/multi-editor area.

#### Preview

Rendered notes are displayed here.

#### Editor

When editing you'll use [Monaco Editor](https://github.com/Microsoft/monaco-editor), the same editor VS Code uses, which comes with features like multi-cursor built-in. Read about the shortcuts this editor supports in the [Shortcuts](@note/07 - Shortcuts.md) tutorial note.

In case the built-in editor doesn't cut it  there's also a button in the toolbar for opening the current note in the default Markdown editor. We just can't include into Notable all features and nice plugins you might have in your default editor.

#### Multi-Editor

When 2 or more notes are selected a multi-note editor will be displayed in the mainbar, read more about this [here](@note/09 - Multi-Note Editing.md).
