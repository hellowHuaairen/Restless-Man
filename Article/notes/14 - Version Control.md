# 14 - Version Control

Notable doesn't have version control built-in, but since the data directory is just a regular directory you could make it a git repository and every once in a while take a snapshot of your notes, or perhaps a small script could make commits automatically for you everytime something changes.

If there's a big demand for this perhaps support for version controlled notes can be added to Notable itself, [let us know](https://github.com/notable/notable/issues) if you need this.
