# 03 - The Middlebar

The middlebar shows you all notes contained in the currently active category, properly ordered and filtered by the search query.

## Search

To search just type something in the search bar.

The title of notes is searched in _fuzzily_, which basically means that you can omit some characters from the query: if for instance there's a note titled "Notable" you can also find it by typing "Noab" or "Notae", as long as the characters are in the right order the note will be found.

The content of notes is searched in too, but not fuzzily, a full-match is required in this case.

## New Note Button

Next to the search bar there's also a button for creating a new note.

## Sorting Order

Right below the search bar you can change the order in which notes are being displayed.

By default this is by `Title - Ascending`, so that the tutorial notes get displayed in order, but you might want to change this later to `Date Modified - Descending`, so that the most recently edited notes are at the top.

## Notes

Lastly there's the notes list.

Notes will have some badges if they are pinned, favorited or have attachments.

Pinned notes are displayed before the others.

If you right-click them you can access some commands, all of them are also available from the app menu, most of them are also available from the mainbar's toolbar.
